short:  Thoughts and concerns on the current trend of backpack designs, and what I am looking for in a perfect bag.

I have very specific requirements for a backpack and I can't find a bag conforms to all of them.

#### Backpack Requirements

- Holds a 15-inch computer
- Holds a standard book nicely
- Contains spots for a phone and laptop charger
- Pen & Pencil Slots
- Not too thick
- Stuff Slot that when "full" doesn't ruin the feel of the bag
- **Stuff Slot**; Not black hole
- Nice but understated
- Ideally Two bottle holders, but one is OK
- Not Tacti-cool

#### Backpacks Tried

- Baron Fig Venture Slimline Backpack
- OnePlus Travel Backpack
- Herschel Heritage Backpack
